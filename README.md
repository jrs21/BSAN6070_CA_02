This is a repository containing the computer assignment #2 on Naive Bayes for BSAN 6070

Purpose:
To train a model to classify whether text from email is spam or not spam.

Instructions: 
Run all the libraries in the first coding block to ensure that the code will work. 
Especially important to run the coding block that mounts the drive (drive.mount from google colab) prior to training the model. 
Imperative that the path for the TRAIN_DIR and TEST_DIR are accurate and leads to the right location of the data containing the email text (i.e. '/content/drive/My Drive/INSERT FOLDER NAME HERE/INSERT NAME OF FILE HERE').
